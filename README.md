Tables 1-5 are all the predicted quantities of emergency material demand at each disaster site obtained through Henan's official website in the early stage and the transportation time and transportation cost obtained through Gaode Map, Tables 6-8 are the overall expected values calculated through the triangular fuzzy number de-fuzzification method, i.e., the fixed values of the material demand, the material dispatch time, and the dispatch cost that are substituted into the code calculations at a later stage, and Table 9 is the estimated emergency material demand for each disaster site obtained from China's national Natural Disaster Management System (NDMS) official website, the investigation reports issued by the State Council Disaster Investigation Group, and the official reports issued by the cities in Henan Province, China, to obtain the values of the emergency coefficients of the emergency material demand calculated in Python.Tables 10-12 show the quantities of materials provided to each disaster site by each outgoing rescue point after the three kinds of emergency materials are calculated by matlab code, and Table 13 is the comprehensive table of its three kinds of material dispatch quantities.Table 14 shows the parameters set for the optimization of emergency material transportation paths, Table 15 shows the routing diagrams of the three multi-affected point routes transported after the calculation of the ant colony algorithm, and Table 16 shows the actual demand for each emergency material at each affected point, which is used for comparing the results of the model calculations and checking the effectiveness of the model.
